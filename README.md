# SparkProject
Title: Apache Spark for data analysis and machine learning on heart disease prediction.

In this project, we will be using the apache spark and its components which is one of the latest technology on big data analytics, for the analysis of the dataset using Spark SQL and detection of existence of heart disease using Spark Mllib. External distributed storage system like Hadoop HDFS was used to load dataset into spark and save the generated trained model which can be used later for prediction of the existence of disease on new data.
